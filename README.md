# Monkeypox Dashboard

Quick visualization of the [global.health](https://global.health/) monkeypox [tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEBhao3rMe-qtCbAgJTn5ZKQMRFWeAeaiXFpBY3gbHE/edit#gid=0).

## Discalimer
Take the numbers with a wagon of salt, the per-date graph especially, currently it uses one of 5 dates: date of symptom onset, date of confirmation, date of hospitalization, date recorded (in the sheet), date last modified (in the sheet) -- in that order, using whichever date is found first.

## Thanks To
Most credit goes to the people populating the Google Sheet, most of the rest of the credit goes to the [highcharts.js library](https://www.highcharts.com/).
